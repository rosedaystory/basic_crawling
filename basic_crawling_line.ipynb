The ADP values are separated into static and dynamic components to get a best fit to the model Debye / Einstein curve. Calculations are based on the Debye, Einstein or mixed model at user’s option. An additional term is first added to the equations to account a possible static disorder. Nonlinear least-square technique is used to refine parameters of the model curve for the set of ADPs observed in the various-temperature structural study. The program provides a good fit up to 0.5 – 2% between the theoretical and observed ADP values. It is quite possible that the best dependence is first achieved within the framework of the Debye or Einstein models between ADPs obtained at different temperatures owing to a simple modification of the formalism',\n",

The user can measure distances, find neighbors, display H bonds, Color by B values, Display by residue type, and a wide variety of other display options. This version also allows the user to display two different molecules and perform 3D least square alignments. The interface is entirely graphically oriented so the user does not have to memorize any line commands. The new 3D rendering output file (3DMF) supports the ribbon, ball&stick, stick, and CPK objects and can be read by 'MolView Lite' also found at this site. Cross-eye and wall-eye stereo is also supported. 'MOL' objects can be read in from 'O' plot files (e.g. electron density) or created in MolView and written out to separate files that can be read in at a later date. This allows 'lessons' to be created without using scripts. Emphasis is on the object-oriented, high resolution, 32bit color output rather than rotation speed.\",\n",

It is made of a core library written in C++ with a GUI written in Qt and a Python API. A special care was brought to design a generic enough core library for integrating easily any instrument through a simple user-defined configuration file.

The search-match methods identify easily the compound phases of the sample. The interaction between the identification and the quantification facilitates the interpretation of diffraction data thanks to a progressive reconstruction of the diffractogram and a probability of presence characterizing each phase. The graphic rebuild, adding up the phase full patterns (Pseudo-Voigt function), shows the contribution of each phase to each observed peak or individual count. The profile and structural parameters are refined simultaneously using the Rietveld analysis : non linear least squares solved by Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm which brings the best stability to the process.\\r\\nOthers main features : Background fit, preferred orientation, amorphous phase content calculated without adding a supplementary phase, validation through chemical composition (if available), memorization of the analysis data for later use or verification, macro-commands for repetitive analyses and fully automated production follow-up.

The analysis can be performed on single- or multiple-phase specimens, trying to fit one or more experimental data sets collected with Synchrotron or laboratory X-ray, neutron and electron beams.

The ADP values are separated into static and dynamic components to get a best fit to the model Debye / Einstein curve. Calculations are based on the Debye, Einstein or mixed model at user’s option. An additional term is first added to the equations to account a possible static disorder. Nonlinear least-square technique is used to refine parameters of the model curve for the set of ADPs observed in the various-temperature structural study. The program provides a good fit up to 0.5 – 2% between the theoretical and observed ADP values. It is quite possible that the best dependence is first achieved within the framework of the Debye or Einstein models between ADPs obtained at different temperatures owing to a simple modification of the formalism',\n",

In addition, it is possible to define the occupancy, residue or part number of the inserted fragment. The fragment can be inverted, e.g. to fit the second conformer of twisted tetrahydrofuran. If desired, automatically calculated distance restraints for all bonds in the molecular fragment can replace the restraints obtained from the database.

The new 3D rendering output file (3DMF) supports the ribbon, ball&stick, stick, and CPK objects and can be read by 'MolView Lite' also found at this site. Cross-eye and wall-eye stereo is also supported. 'MOL' objects can be read in from 'O' plot files (e.g. electron density) or created in MolView and written out to separate files that can be read in at a later date.

It is made of a core library written in C++ with a GUI written in Qt and a Python API. A special care was brought to design a generic enough core library for integrating easily any instrument through a simple user-defined configuration file.

The interaction between the identification and the quantification facilitates the interpretation of diffraction data thanks to a progressive reconstruction of the diffractogram and a probability of presence characterizing each phase. The graphic rebuild, adding up the phase full patterns (Pseudo-Voigt function), shows the contribution of each phase to each observed peak or individual count.
